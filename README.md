# Quant-Backtesting-Famework
Python-based framework to backtest quantitative trading strategies on historical market data

# Backtesting Quantitative Trading Strategies

This repository contains a Python-based backtesting framework developed as part of the Summer of Quant 2025 program conducted by the Quant Club, IIT Kharagpur.
The project evaluates rule-based quantitative trading strategies using historical market data and standard performance metrics.

# Project Overview

The goal of this project was to:

Design a modular backtesting pipeline

Implement and compare multiple quantitative trading strategies

Analyze risk-adjusted performance using real financial data

The framework simulates end-to-end portfolio behavior, including signal generation, trade execution logic, and performance evaluation.

# Strategies Implemented

Moving Average Crossover Strategy

MACD-based Trading Strategy

Strategies were tested on multiple equities using 5+ years of historical price data.

# Performance Metrics

Each strategy was evaluated using:

Cumulative returns

Volatility

Sharpe ratio

Comparative analysis was used to assess risk-adjusted performance across strategies.

# Methodology

Download historical price data using yfinance

Generate trading signals based on strategy rules

Simulate portfolio performance

Compute performance and risk metrics

Visualize equity curves and comparisons

# Tech Stack

Language: Python

Libraries:

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib

yfinance

# Recognition

Completed Elementary and Advanced modules of Summer of Quant 2025

Selected for Advanced Cohort after qualifying assessment

Awarded Certificate of Merit by Quant Club, IIT Kharagpur

# Learning Outcomes

Practical exposure to quantitative finance workflows
